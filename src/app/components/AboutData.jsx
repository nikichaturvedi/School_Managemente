                        Beginning in <span className='font-bold text-[#555d6d]'>early education and preschool</span>, students will begin to develop critical <span className='font-bold text-[#555d6d]'>leadership</span> skills. When they reach the Lower and Upper Schools, they emerge more confident, poised, and prepared to succeed. With our <span className='font-bold text-[#555d6d]'>updated approach to a classic curriculum</span>, Wyndcroft's faculty guides students through a rigorous academic program that cultivates a sense of gratitude and responsibility toward the larger world.
